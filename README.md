# StatCrunching
A backup of code from a summer research thing. Poorly documented, only really needed to work while I was personally there to adjust it. Lang_Prob_Parser.py is the script used to check the sanity of the various csv files.

There are also some other, unrelated files in here. C_thun.py, for instance, is a monte carlo simulator for a Hearthstone card.
